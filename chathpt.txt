Based on your project proposal, you’ve outlined a clear plan for predicting temperature using historical weather data. Here are the next steps you might consider:

Implement the LSTM Model: You’ve mentioned using LSTM networks for your project. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, making it a good choice for time-series forecasting like this. You’ll need to implement this model and train it on your data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Both Random Forest and LSTM models have several hyperparameters that can significantly impact their performance. You might consider using techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for your models.
Feature Engineering: You might want to consider creating new features that could help improve the performance of your models. For example, you could create features that capture the trend or seasonality in the temperature data.
Model Evaluation: After training your models, you’ll need to evaluate their performance. You’ve mentioned using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as your evaluation metrics, which are good choices for regression tasks. You might also consider using other metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or R-squared.
Results Analysis and Visualization: Analyze the results of your models. Which model performed better? Can you identify any patterns in the errors made by the models? Visualizing your results can often provide useful insights.
Documentation and Final Report: Document your process, findings, and insights. This will be helpful for both you and others who might want to understand your work.
Remember, data science projects are iterative processes. You might not get the best results in your first attempt, but don’t get discouraged. Keep experimenting, tweaking your models, and you’ll improve over time.

To implement an LSTM model for your project, you can use the Keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Here’s a basic example of how you might structure your code:

Python

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import numpy as np

# Assuming you have 8 features in your data
n_features = 8

# Define the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(None, n_features)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Prepare your data
# X should be a 3D array of shape (n_samples, n_timesteps, n_features)
# Y should be a 2D array of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
# In your case, n_outputs would be 1 because you're predicting temperature

# Fit the model
model.fit(X, Y, epochs=200, verbose=0)

This is a very basic example. In practice, you would need to preprocess your data to the correct shape, tune the architecture of the LSTM model (e.g., number of layers, number of neurons per layer), and possibly normalize your data before feeding it into the model.

Remember, LSTM models can be quite sensitive to the scale of the data. If your features are on different scales, you might want to normalize them to a standard range (e.g., 0-1) before training your model.
